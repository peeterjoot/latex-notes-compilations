- ALL: 

   refresh kdp version to pick up new cleaner black and white "color scheme".

- GAelectrodynamics

   Finish the color/bw figure specialization, and re-upload.

   fig 1.5 should have shading to show the difference in orientation.  Not clear -- even in color.

- phy452-basicstatmech
   kdp: fig 7.43 -- fonts not embedded properly.  Redo with matex.

- phy485-optics
      -- Refresh some of the figures (thick/black/...), then post anew.

- ready to upload:

   Go through all the pdf links, and if any are to non-versioned versions, update those, and
   add separate landing pages for each of these:

- Figures:

   Review everything looking at the Mathematia based figures to see which should be updated:
     - PlotStyle -> Thick
     - MaTeX
     - texStyle

- 6x9 instructions:

   - specialize:
      backmatter.tex
      GNUmakefile # new path for $(THISBOOK).tex, ...
      thisbook.sty -- need at least mychapter definition.
      classicthesis-config.tex
      hack preface.tex for the page numbering position bug (add: \thispagestyle{empty})
      customize the dedication and change the rules to avoid the generic one being used (do this for phy485)
      chapter -> mychapter

      git commit -a
      make clean;make

- Proofing checklist:

   - Equation grammar.
   - Spell check.
   - Periods for chapters, examples, figures, section, subsection, paragraphs.
   - Run urlcheckerpy
   - Run thethe.py
   - Don't use dmath+aligned:  grep -nB1 {aligned} `cat thefiles` | grep {dmath}
   - Fix gutter overflow issues.
   - Look for dmaths in makeproblem, makeexamples, and itemize that lead to inset equation numbers.
   - Check for equations that overlap equation numbers.
   - Check the size of the figures.
   - Check indexes for entries with different spelling/case.
   - Make sure all the indexing is done.  at least chapter,section,paragraph,problems
   - make dist, tag
   - push
   - copy to kdp, leanpub, landing page.
   - bump version.
